serive communication:



dns----when we request like google.com dnsserver coredns whichnis having fixed ip of coredns which will in resolve.cong....coredns will give serivceip(cluster ip)...
when ever there is commnuication with  that service ip then kube proxy will have assosiated with that service ip and will forward the request to the pod which is running that service...


beacuse if ip table routr---kube proxy will know the service ip beacuse if ip table route
from service ip---pod
